ranged_hands mod, made for bls, can be used anywhere 
would suggest integrating this with a ranks mod or some 
other element of gameplay  

notes:  optional depends on default for wieldimage.png  
        optional depends on creative to force it to load 
        first else it will screw up the ranged hand when 
        nothing is in it  

simple proof of concept design, could be better integrated 
into other servers or games
